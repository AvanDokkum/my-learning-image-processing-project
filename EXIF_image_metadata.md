# Dating the images:

The correct **EXIF tag** for the original date the photograph was taken (the true creation date) is:

### **Tag Name:** `DateTimeOriginal`
- **EXIF Tag ID:** `0x9003`
- **Description:** The date and time when the photo was originally taken by the camera (not when it was modified or copied).

### **Other Date-Related EXIF Tags:**
1. **`DateTime` (0x0132)** – Often called "File Change Date," this refers to when the image file was last modified.
2. **`DateTimeDigitized` (0x9004)** – The date when the image was converted into digital format, e.g., from film to digital.
3. **`SubSecTimeOriginal` (0x9291)** – If available, this stores milliseconds for more precise timestamps.

### **Example of EXIF Date Metadata**
When inspecting EXIF metadata, you might see something like this:

```
DateTimeOriginal: 2024:03:08 15:30:45
DateTimeDigitized: 2024:03:08 15:30:45
DateTime: 2025:01:15 12:05:30
```
- The first value (`DateTimeOriginal`) is when the photo was actually taken.
- The second (`DateTimeDigitized`) is when it was converted to digital format.
- The third (`DateTime`) is when the file was last modified.
