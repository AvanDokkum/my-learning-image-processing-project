### **What is a POJO in Java?**
A **POJO (Plain Old Java Object)** is a simple Java class that follows a few basic rules:
- It **does not** extend any specific class (like `HttpServlet`) or implement any special interface (like `Serializable` unless required).
- It contains **private fields** (variables) with **public getter and setter methods** to access and modify them.
- It has a **default constructor** (a constructor with no arguments).
- It **does not** use any special annotations or complex logic inside.

Essentially, a POJO is a **simple, reusable** Java object that is not dependent on any specific Java framework.

### **Example of a POJO**

Hereâ€™s a basic example of a POJO representing a `Person`:

```java
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    // Default constructor
    public Person() {
    }

    // Parameterized constructor
    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    // Getter for name
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    // Setter for name
    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    // Getter for age
    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    // Setter for age
    public void setAge(int age) {
        this.age = age;
    }
}
```

### **When to Use POJOs?**

POJOs are **widely used** in Java applications because they provide a **clean and structured** way to store and manipulate data. You should use POJOs when:

1. **Defining Data Models**
    - POJOs are commonly used to represent data in applications, such as database entities (before adding annotations in JPA/Hibernate).

2. **Transferring Data (DTO - Data Transfer Object)**
    - POJOs can act as **DTOs** to carry data between different parts of an application or between a client and a server.

3. **Encapsulation and Data Hiding**
    - Since POJOs use **private fields with getters and setters**, they help in **encapsulating** data and enforcing controlled access.

4. **Serialization (if needed)**
    - If a POJO implements `Serializable`, it can be converted into a stream of bytes and transferred over a network or saved to a file.

5. **Compatibility with Frameworks**
    - Many Java frameworks (like Spring, Hibernate, Jackson) work well with POJOs because they follow standard conventions.

### **When Not to Use POJOs?**

Although POJOs are simple and flexible, they **may not** be the best choice in certain scenarios:

1. **For Business Logic (Service Layer)**
    - POJOs are meant for storing data, not for containing complex business logic.
    - Instead, **use Service classes** for business logic and keep POJOs clean.

2. **When Records are Better (`record` in Java 14+)**
    - If your class is **only for data storage** and doesnâ€™t need mutability, consider using a **record** instead of a POJO.

   ```java
   public record PersonRecord(String name, int age) {}
   ```

    - Records automatically generate getters, constructors, `toString()`, `equals()`, and `hashCode()` methods, making them more efficient than POJOs for immutable data.

3. **For Highly Specialized Classes**
    - If you need a class to follow a strict framework-specific structure (e.g., `@Entity` in JPA or `@Component` in Spring), a POJO might **not** be enough, and you'll need additional annotations.

### **Summary**
| Feature | POJO |
|---------|------|
| **Definition** | A simple Java class with fields, getters, setters, and no special dependencies |
| **Use Cases** | Data models, DTOs, simple objects for storage, encapsulation |
| **Advantages** | Clean, reusable, framework-friendly, easy to serialize |
| **When Not to Use** | Business logic, immutable data (use `record`), specialized framework classes |

POJOs are a **fundamental** concept in Java development, and understanding when to use them (or not) will help you write **clean and maintainable** code! ðŸš€
