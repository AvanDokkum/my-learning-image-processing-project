# My learning image processing project
A learning project - by AvanDokkum  
How can I create a program to organize lots of images on a local drive.
- The original images should not be deleted but copied. 
- The copied images should be bundled and organized on date.
- The images should get the creation date appended to the file name. 
- The copied images should be deduplicated so no double images remain.
- The original quality of the images should remain after copying. 
- The program should facilitate local drive backups for long term storage. 
- check if the input and output images are the same

## Topics - "learning topics in this project"

- [YCbCr vs RGB](YCbCr&RGB.md)
- [Path&Paths_API](Path&Paths_API.md)
- [File/Files API](File&Files_API.md)
- [Stream_API](Stream_API.md)
- [POJO](POJO.md)
- [Date vs LocalDateTime](Date&LocalDate.md)

## Add research to documentation: 
- [JFileChooser]
- [Iterator<>]
- [ImageIO_API]
- Comparable<>
- Generic<>
- Optional<>
- Predicate<> class (same as Consumer<>, Supplier<>, and Function<>?) https://www.youtube.com/shorts/mz8qio7f5lQ
- Entity vs DTO
- functional programming deep dive
- pattern matching

## Research question: 
- How do I design a professional microservice architecture?
- what is "lazy loading"? vs not lazy loading?
- Records cannot be proxied; what does this mean?

Image processing:
- What is discrete cosine transform (dct) and how does it work?
- What is Huffman coding theory and how is it used?
- What is the difference between al image formats, which one to exclude from my program?
