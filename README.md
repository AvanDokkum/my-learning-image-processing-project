# My learning image processing project
A learning project - by AvanDokkum  
How can I create a program to organize lots of images on a local drive.
- The original images should not be deleted but copied. 
- The copied images should be bundled and organized on date.
- The images should get the creation date appended to the file name. 
- The copied images should be deduplicated so no double images remain.
- The original quality of the images should remain after copying. 
- The program should facilitate local drive backups for long term storage.
