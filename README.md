# My learning image processing project
A learning project - by AvanDokkum  
How can I create a program to organize lots of images on a local drive.
- The original images should not be deleted but copied. 
- The copied images should be bundled and organized on date.
- The images should get the creation date appended to the file name. 
- The copied images should be deduplicated so no double images remain.
- The original quality of the images should remain after copying. 
- The program should facilitate local drive backups for long term storage. 
- check if the input and output images are the same

- Read EXIF data (libraries like https://exiftool.org/ and https://github.com/drewnoakes/metadata-extractor)

- what is "lazy loading"? vs not lazy loading?
- Records cannot be proxied; what does this mean?


AI explaining concepts:
The best way to ask is to structure your question like this:
1. **Specify the concept clearly** – e.g., *"Can you explain Java Records?"*
2. **Define the level of depth** – e.g., *"I want a practical explanation suitable for an experienced Java developer."*
3. **Request comparisons (if relevant)** – e.g., *"How do Records differ from regular classes and Lombok?"*
4. **Ask for real-world use cases** – e.g., *"When should I use Records in a backend application?"*
5. **Include coding examples** – e.g., *"Please provide a simple and an advanced example with best practices."*
### Example Question:
*"Can you explain Java Records? I’m an experienced Java developer and want a practical understanding of how they work, how they compare to regular classes and Lombok, and when to use them in backend applications. Please include both a simple and an advanced example with best practices."*
This way, AI gives a **fast, structured, and complete** explanation with examples that fit.
