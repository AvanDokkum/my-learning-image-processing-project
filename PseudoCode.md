V1:

* Pseudocode image sorting on date and copy images to new folder
* 1: locate the images input folder via a GUI
* 2: create a new folder for the output images
* 3: read all images in the folder
* 4: Locate the name(or location) + date data and put it in an object array.
* : sort the array on dates from oldest to newest.
* : copy images into the new folder
* : test if images are copied and sorted on dates

ImageDynamicObject pseudocode:

//Can I add this ImageDynamicObject to a list/array to save it?
//Deduplicating the images by name?
//Saving the image path into the object for later duplication
//Sorting the list on date-image-taken
//Adding the date-image-taken to file name (to sort the images in file explorer automatically)
//Copying image into output folder on month/day scheme

AI explaining concepts:
The best way to ask is to structure your question like this:
1. **Specify the concept clearly** – e.g., *"Can you explain Java Records?"*
2. **Define the level of depth** – e.g., *"I want a practical explanation suitable for an experienced Java developer."*
3. **Request comparisons (if relevant)** – e.g., *"How do Records differ from regular classes and Lombok?"*
4. **Ask for real-world use cases** – e.g., *"When should I use Records in a backend application?"*
5. **Include coding examples** – e.g., *"Please provide a simple and an advanced example with best practices."*

### Example Question:
*"Can you explain Java Records? I’m an experienced Java developer and want a practical understanding of how they work, how they compare to regular classes and Lombok, and when to use them in backend applications. Please include both a simple and an advanced example with best practices."*
This way, AI gives a **fast, structured, and complete** explanation with examples that fit.
